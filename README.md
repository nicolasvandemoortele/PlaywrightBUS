# Playwright showcase

Using the Ringier Event Bus Admin, this showcases the implementation of a Playwright e2e test suite using:
* Page Object Model
* Fixtures
* Project setup dependencies (to avoid authenticating for each test)
* Environments
* Wait for API request (avoid flakyness by waiting for API calls completion)
* Data driven testing (TODO)
* Handle multiple tabs
* Accessibility testing (TODO)
